Description: granulator is an R package for the cell type deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on bulk RNA-seq data or single cell RNA-seq expression profiles. The package provides a unified testing interface to rapidly run and benchmark multiple state-of-the-art deconvolution methods. Data for the deconvolution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into individual immune cell types is provided as well.
